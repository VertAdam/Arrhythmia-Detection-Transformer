# Arrhythmia-Detection-Transformer
Final Project for Georgia Tech 7643: Deep Learning

TODO:

Short Term:
- [ ] Explore different datasets and decide on which one(s) to use
- [ ] Get Comparison Algorithm (CNN) Running
- [ ] Create wide and deep transformer from https://www.cinc.org/archives/2020/pdf/CinC2020-107.pdf

Mid Term:
- [ ] Optimize hyperparameters for models
- [ ] Determine any novel ideas that can be implemented (data augmentation, additional layers, etc.)

End:
- [ ] Finalize figures/tables for report
- [ ] Write report
